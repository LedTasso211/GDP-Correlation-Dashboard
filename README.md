# GDP-Correlation-Dashboard
The dashboard explores the relationship between GDP and various social variables using data from the year 2019. 

The dashboard I created explores the relationship between GDP and various social variables using data from the year 2019. The assumption behind this analysis is that wealthier countries tend to exhibit more favorable outcomes in these social variables compared to poorer countries. The choice of 2019 as the data year was pragmatic, as it provided the most extensive data availability for the variables analyzed.
The data used in the dashboard consists of numerical, continuous variables, allowing for the construction of scatterplots to examine correlations between variables. Most of the data was sourced from the World Bank website. Here is a shortened description of the social variables analyzed and the corresponding data sources:

1.	GDP Per Capita (World Bank - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD)
GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear population. 

2.	Homicide rate (World Bank - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5) 
This data includes information about Intentional homicides per 100,000 people in the country. Intentional homicides are estimates of unlawful homicides purposely inflicted as a result of domestic disputes, interpersonal violence, violent conflicts over land resources, intergang violence over turf or control, and predatory violence and killing by armed groups.

3.	Life Expectancy (World Bank - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN) 

4.	Infant Mortality Rate (World Bank - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.IMRT.IN) 
DaInfant mortality rate is the number of infants dying before reaching one year of age, per 1,000 live births in a given year. 

5.	Secondary School Enrollment (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.SEC.ENRR)
Gross enrollment ratio is the ratio of total enrollment, regardless of age, to the population of the age group that officially corresponds to the level of education shown. Secondary education completes the provision of basic education that began at the primary level, and aims at laying the foundations for lifelong learning and human development, by offering more subject- or skill-oriented instruction using more specialized teachers.

6.	University Enrollment (World Bank - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.TER.ENRR)  
Gross enrollment ratio is the ratio of total enrollment, regardless of age, to the population of the age group that officially corresponds to the level of education shown. Tertiary education, whether or not to be an advanced research qualification, normally requires, as a minimum condition of admission, the successful completion of education at the secondary level.

7.	Unemployment (World Bank - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.NE.ZS)

8.	Press Freedom Index (World Bank - https://tcdata360.worldbank.org/indicators/h3f86901f?country=BRA&indicator=32416&viz=line_chart&years=2002,2022)
The data is collected through an online questionnaire sent to journalists, media lawyers, researchers and other media specialists. It shows how free the media is in the country. Lower the index, freer the media.
